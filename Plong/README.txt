The right paddle may choose to play against the computer or another player.
The left player moves with the w and s keys.

__GAMEPLAY_________
This game differs from Pong in two ways: the paddles have inertia, and you can perform a curve-shot. 
If a paddle hits the ball while moving fast enough, the ball will curve towards the ceiling/floor. 
After the curving ball hits the ceiling/floor,it will zoom diagonally towards the opposing goal at a fast speed. 
First to 10 points wins. 




Thanks for playing!
